This repository has multiple purposes:

* Issue and feature request tracker
* Release note repository
* Wiki aimed towards developers to share and document quirks, tricks and necessary hacks

## Submitting new issues

When submitting a new issue or a feature request, there are a few steps you should take:

* Look through the current list and see if yours might be a duplicate, in which case you should comment on the original thread instead.
* Try to fill out our issue template. We appreciate any relevant information that might assist us solving the problem or implementing the feature. Also don't forget to add a relevant "bug" or "feature" label to the created issue.
